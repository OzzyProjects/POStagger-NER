# Stanford POS Penn Treebank annotated file to universal POS (kind of map_tag function from NLTK)

sys.argv[1] = annotated Stanford Penn Treebank source file.

sys.argv[2] = correlation table file between Penn Treebank POS and universal POS.

You may find in this repository a correlation table named named POSTags_PTB_Universal_Linux.txt

You can use it of course.

Conversion with regexp only.

In fact, you can use NLTK module with map_tag function for the same purpose.
